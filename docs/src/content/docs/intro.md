# Introduction

Welcome to the Ocean Clean X documentation!

Ocean Clean X is an open-source project that aims to clean up the ocean through autonomous catamarans. All the information about this project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/BrandenXia/OceanCleanX).

This documentation is intended to provide a comprehensive guide to the project, including the design, implementation, and testing of the autonomous catamarans. It is intended to provide details about both software and hardware components of the project, as well as how we combine them to create a fully functional system.
